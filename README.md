# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-using-CNN
This repository presents an implementation of a hand gesture recognition system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to accurately classify hand gestures based on input images, allowing for applications in human-computer interaction, sign language recognition, and virtual reality control.
